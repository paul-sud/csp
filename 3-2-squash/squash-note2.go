/*
Problem: Adapt the previous program to replace every
pair of consecutive asterisks "**" by an upward arrow
"↑". Assume that the final character input is not an
asterisk.

(2) As an exercise, adapt
this process to deal sensibly with input which ends with
an odd number of asterisks.

In Go, one solution is for west to close the channel to indicate to the copy goroutine
that there are no more values to be sent. Then the goroutine doesn't get blocked trying
to recieve the next value from the channel when west does not have any more characters
to send.
