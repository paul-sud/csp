/*
5.3 Dining Philosophers (Problem due to E.W. Dijkstra)
Problem: Five philosophers spend their lives thinking
and eating. The philosophers share a common dining
room where there is a circular table surrounded by five
chairs, each belonging to one philosopher. In the center
of the table there is a large bowl of spaghetti, and the
table is laid with five forks (see Figure 1). On feeling
hungry, a philosopher enters the dining room, sits in his
own chair, and picks up the fork on the left of his place.
Unfortunately, the spaghetti is so tangled that he needs
to pick up and use the fork on his right as well. When he
has finished, he puts down both forks, and leaves the
room. The room should keep a count of the number of
philosophers.

Notes: Try playing with the constants to see how the system behaves.
